BBUS 461 - Government, Business, and Society
Instructor: Walter Hutchens
Mondays & Wednesdays, 5:30 � 5:30 pm
Pre-Fall Quarter 2011



COURSE INTRODUCTION
Many classes in business programs focus on how a firm
manages its internal affairs or on how a firm relates to
other private-sector parties such as customers,
competitors and capital suppliers. This course instead
focuses on how a business relates to government and
civil society. The premise is that government and civil
society can dramatically affect a business�indeed,
government and civil society can cause a business to
succeed or fail�thus excellent business managers must
deal successfully with the political and social worlds
(government and civil society), not just the private
commercial sector.

To help equip you to do this, we will examine a
number of case studies. Through this process you will 1)
learn about the specific instances studied (which may
related to industries or firms in which you will work), 2)
gain a richer understanding of the structure of
government and civil society and 3) observe patterns of
how businesses, government and civil society interact.
We will study enduring debates about the duties of
business and the appropriate role for government and
what economic and political principles and systems lead
to the best outcomes. At the end of the course you
should be better equipped to help a business succeed by
recognizing ways it can be affected by government and
civil society and knowing some steps you might take to
affect those interactions, as well as being conversant
with several important contemporary issues and the
enduring debates behind them.

You may find this course to be unlike some
others you have experienced. Although there is an
assigned textbook, you will need to do more than scan
the textbook, load some of its bullet points into your
short-term memory and sort through some choices on a
multiple choice test to do well. Some learning may occur
through such a textbook-driven process, but in general I
believe that �game� does not create especially valuable
skills or knowledge that sticks with you. We will instead
learn through careful, close readings and rigorous
discussions. Often we will read primary sources, not
materials that have been pre-digested to textbook level.
In class I will lead Socratic discussions about these
materials, pressing you to think through problems aloud
and apply your knowledge to novel hypothetical
situations. We will also have in-class group
presentations.

Some of you will relish the less structured, �real
world� nature of this course. Others may sometimes feel
uncertain, anxious or awkward. This could be because at
this point in your academic careers�16 years of
schooling for most of you!�you have become quite
skilled at discerning what a teacher wants and gauging
how to efficiently comply relying on the standard
accoutrements of student life (textbooks, course outlines,
study guides). This course may ask you to step out of
that comfort zone. We will often be studying matters that
are too recent to be in the textbook, even though it was
recently updated. If you ever feel adrift, try to relax. It is
natural to feel a bit disoriented in an upper-division class
that seeks to introduce you to complex, important, and
unresolved topics. The process will prepare you to join
the fray�not as students, but as active participants in the
still-unfolding, real-world drama of business,
government and society.

4	EXAM & PRESENTATIONS


NOTES:
� The final exam will consist mainly of
questions that require brief written
responses. You will be asked to identify
with specificity certain people, institutions
and events as well as offer broader
conceptual responses.

� You will work on final group project that
includes a group class presentation. The
membership of your group and topic of
your presentation must be approved by the
instructor by the second week of class.
The topic of your presentation will
concern a current issue of significance that
illustrates interactions between business,
government and society as studied in the
course, and your group will brief the rest
of the class on the issue. Your presentation
should be through, covering key details
and concepts. However, the presentation
should also be concise, engaging and
focused enough so that your classmates
and instructor find the material memorable
and the signal-to-noise ratio high.

� You are responsible for all material
presented during class (or discussed in
class) and for all material in the assigned
readings. You must also be reasonably
conversant with current affairs,
particularly those with significant
implications for business. Current events
questions may be asked during class and
may appear on quizzes or exams.

� Preparation for every class is a basic
course requirement. In order to
participate effectively, you must carefully
study and reflect upon the assigned
reading before each class and bring the
assigned material to class for reference or
have access to it. You must also bring a
writing instrument and paper (�duh�).

� Use of electronic devices during class is
permitted, but I discourage you from
conquering new levels of Angry Birds,
updating Facebook or texting during class. It
can be distracting to the rest of us, and if
you are physically present but mentally
absent it not only reduces your own learning
but tends to deny the rest of us the chance to
learn from your active class participation.

� Class participation grades will be
assigned based on my judgment regarding
the quantity and quality of each student�s
participation. Attendance alone does not
constitute sufficient class participation.
However, absences will diminish your
class participation score, especially in a
compressed format class like this. Failure
to attend faithfully and participate robustly
in class discussions will negatively affect
your grade. Students may volunteer to
speak in class and may also be called
upon. But please understand that is your
job, not mine, to be sure that you speak up
enough during class in order to score class
participation points. As business students,
it may be helpful if you think of it as a
marketing project�you need to market
your personal brand, lodge yourself in my
mind in a positive way, gain favorable
"mindshare" with the instructor and your
classmates. If you sit there silently, I
cannot know whether you are clueless or
merely shy. So vocalize. However,
dominating the conversation to the degree
that you marginalize others is frowned
upon. Also, while vigorous debate is
encouraged, be careful to attack ideas, not
people. Belittling other class members is
strongly disfavored. Strive to disagree, if
you must, without being disagreeable. In
other words, talk a lot, but don't be a jerk.

� If you only cram before the exam, less
learning occurs and class meetings are
much less fun. To help encourage you to
build your knowledge incrementally,
periodic, un-announced quizzes will be
given. I may also assign brief homework
assignments. No make-up quizzes are
available, and homework cannot be turned
in late for credit. However, if you miss or
bomb a single quiz or homework
assignment, that will not devastate your
final grade. Repeated neglect, however,
will of course have a substantial negative
impact.

� Make-up exams or presentations are
allowed only under extraordinary
circumstances and at the sole discretion of
Prof. Hutchens.

� As a moral person, you do not want to
cheat because it is the wrong thing to do,
and you have self-respect and a
conscience. Moreover, as a rational
person who studies business, you should
recognize that the small potential benefit
you might obtain by cheating on any
assignment is vastly outweighed by the
harm you would incur if caught. The
opprobrium and harm is so substantial, in
fact, that even if you judge the probability
of getting caught as quite low, it still does
not make sense on a cost-benefit basis.
Most UWB students do not cheat, and I
personally abhor academic dishonesty. To
be clear, if you get caught cheating, you
are likely to fail the assignment and may
also fail this class.

� In electronic communications, please use
your UWB email account and identify
yourself. Like most of you, I receive too
much email and have a busy life outside of
this class, so do not expect an
instantaneous response. However, if you
send me a note and do not get a response
after a couple of days, feel free to follow
up (I can be an absent minded professor).

� You are encouraged to consult the
syllabus, ask other students and talk with
me about a missed class, but as a rule
asking, �Did I miss anything important?�
is frowned upon. I hope the answer is
never, �No, we all got together and just
wasted each other�s time!� I cannot
reenact or summarize a four-hour class for
each absent student. You are, however,
always encouraged to ask specific
questions.

� Best wishes for a happy and intellectually
enriching (and short!) pre-fall quarter. I
am looking forward to getting to know
you better and exploring the interaction of
business, government and society with
you.

Your career and life are unfolding in a world that
makes �global business� an essentially redundant
expression. Even �local� products are now
commonly enmeshed in global supply chains, labor
markets, capital flows, and regulatory and
environmental webs. Even if you could source,
create and market a product or service within a
single jurisdiction, it is likely that you will face
competition that does not. Even if you and your
competitors are pure domestic enterprises, you are
still likely to be affected by global business through
the prices you pay for commodities, labor and
capital. Thus, even if you never get a passport and
travel abroad, international trade and investment will
almost certainly affect you. Indeed, the globalization
of business has likely already had an enormous
impact on your life, influencing your clothing,
transportation, personal electronics, energy
consumption, food, entertainment choices, job
prospects and interest rates.

Complexity multiplies when goods, projects and
money cross borders. Differences in political
economy, levels of development, culture, language
and law dramatically affect how business gets done
in different places. All of the functional areas of a
business�including marketing, human resources
management, treasury and finance operations,
supply chain management, manufacturing, research
and development and strategy�can be dramatically
affected when geographical contexts shift.
To help you thrive in this global environment,
this course will first provide a framework for
understanding how the global environment of
business differs from doing business in a purely
local or single-country context.

After setting this broad �horizontal� context we
will next study China in particular, adding a
�vertical� dimension to the course. China�s
importance in the world economy is obvious�it is a
1) key base of production, 2) vast potential market,
3) source of capital and 4) target for investments. It
also has growing cultural, political and
environmental importance. The material studied in
the first part of the course will helps us understand
some of the challenges of doing business China. For
example, China will illustrate some of the
difficulties of doing business in �emerging� and
�transitional� economies. These lessons may be
applicable to other important markets. We will also
pay some attention to India as another important
developing economy that in some ways is quite
similar to and in other ways quite different from
China.
To conclude the course you will collaborate
with other students to offer advice about where and
how a particular business should expand globally.
�Writing� is also an important theme of the
course (hence its �W� designation). By completing
1) a short individual writing assignments, 2) a longer
group paper that is part of your final project and 3)
several in-class writing exercises, you will hone
your writing skills through this class.

mainstream newspaper each day or by
some other means stay reasonably
conversant with current international affairs,
particularly those with significant business
ramifications.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

After the course you will be able to:

1. articulate a list of ways doing business
in a global context differs from doing
business within a single national
jurisdiction (because of differences in
law, language, culture, political
systems, currency, development levels
and other matters);

2. better understand China which is as an
example of an important "emerging" or
"transition" economy and whose
development is a "megatrend" almost
certain to shape your life and experience
in business (because of China's
importance as a manufacturing base,
market, source of capital and destination
for investing capital and significant
nation in terms of its military, political
and environmental influence) and

3. write well, or at least with more
confidence and fluency than you had
before the course, because this is an
essential skill in your toolkit, and also
because the course is designated as a
"W" or writing course.

These are the main course objectives.

Additionally, after this course you should:

� Be able to articulate causes and
consequences of globalization and its
multifaceted impact on business practices.

� Appreciate some important differences
among countries and cultures that impact
business.

� Describe alternative means of
participation in global commerce and
articulate the pros and cons of these
alternatives in different contexts.

� Understand key terms and concepts in
international trade theory.

� Understand the interplay of international
and municipal (or �national�) law onUnderstand the interplay of international
and municipal (or �national�) law on
commerce and how trans-national
organizations such as the World Trade
Organization and European Union affect
business.

� Be aware of common ethical dilemmas
that arise in relation to international
business.

� Be able to articulate some of the key
consequences and challenges of China�s
economic transformation.

NOTES:

� Exams will consist mainly of objective
questions, such as multiple-choice and
true/false problems and questions that
require brief written responses. The first
exams will cover the material from the
textbook and introductory lectures. The
second exam will cover the material on
China. The final exam will cover the
material presented in the final third of the
quarter including student presentations
(the final is not cumulative or
comprehensive).

� Details about a graded, outside-of-class
individual writing assignments (of about
5 pages, single spaced) will be discussed
in class.

� You will work on team project that
includes a class presentation and a final
paper. You may work on this individually
or as part of a team having four to five
members. You or your team will pick a
country (with approval from the
instructor) and make a 20-minute
presentation to the class concerning the
chosen country with respect to a specific
business venture. The presentation should
be through, profiling your subject country
using resources and categories of analysis
discussed during the semester. However,
the presentation should also be concise,
engaging and focused enough so that a
busy executive would find the material
memorable and the signal-to-noise ratio
high.

� Along with the final oral class
presentation, you or your team will submit
a written paper to the professor on the
day of the final exam. The paper will be
no more than 20 textual pages (with the
bibliography, title page and other ancillary
material not included in the page count).
The paper will provide citations to
credible data sources and summarize the
key findings of your research. Imagine the
paper as advice to an executive regarding
whether and how to expand the given
venture to the particular place you
evaluated.

� You are responsible for all material
presented during class (or discussed in
class) and for all assigned material in the
textbook and other readings. You must
also be reasonably conversant with
current international affairs, particularly
those with significant implications for
business. Examples of the type of current
events questions that may appear on
quizzes or exams will be provided early in
the semester.

� Preparation for every class is a basic
course requirement. In order to
participate effectively, you must carefully
study the assigned reading before each
class and bring your textbook (or at least
its relevant portions) or assigned book to
class for reference. You must also bring a
writing instrument and paper (�duh�).

� Class participation grades will be
assigned based on the instructor�s
judgment regarding the quantity and
quality of each student�s participation.
Attendance alone does not constitute
sufficient class participation, though
repeated absences will diminish your class
participation score. Students may
volunteer to speak in class and may also
be called upon. Students who are
especially reluctant to speak during class
should see the instructor during office
hours; I am willing to coach you to help
overcome apprehensions, but failure to
attend and participate robustly in class
discussions will negatively affect your
grade.

� If you only cram before exams, less
learning occurs and class meetings are
much less fun. To help encourage you to
build your knowledge incrementally,
periodic, un-announced quizzes will be
given. No make-up quizzes are available.
However, all students will have an
opportunity to earn more than 100 points
on quizzes�through extra quizzes and
extra credit questions on particular
quizzes. Thus, if you miss or bomb a
single quiz it should not devastate your
final grade.

� Make-up exams are allowed only under
extraordinary circumstances and at the
sole discretion of Prof. Hutchens.

� As a moral person, you do not want to
cheat because it is the wrong thing to do
and you have a conscience. As a rational
person who studies business, you should
recognize that the small potential benefit
you might obtain by cheating on any
assignment is vastly outweighed by the

be clear, if you get caught cheating, you
are likely to fail the assignment and may
also fail this class.

me about a missed class, but as a rule
asking, �Did I miss anything important?�
is frowned upon. I hope the answer is
never, �No, we all got together and just
wasted each other�s time!�

� Best wishes for a happy and intellectually
enriching quarter. I am looking forward to
getting to know you and helping you learn
about the global environment of business.

1) key base of production, 2) vast potential market,
3) source of capital and 4) target for investments. It
also has growing cultural, political and
environmental importance. The material studied in
the first part of the course will helps us understand
some of the challenges of doing business China. For
example, China will illustrate some of the
difficulties of doing business in �emerging� and
�transitional� economies. These lessons may be
applicable to other important markets. We will also
pay some attention to India as another important
developing economy that in some ways is quite
similar to and in other ways quite different from
China.
To conclude the course you will collaborate
with other students to offer advice about where and
how a particular business should expand globally.
�Writing� is also an important theme of the
course (hence its �W� designation). By completing
1) a short individual writing assignments, 2) a longer
group paper that is part of your final project and 3)
several in-class writing exercises, you will hone
your writing skills through this class.

1. Students are required to scan a national,
mainstream newspaper each day or by
some other means stay reasonably
conversant with current international affairs,
particularly those with significant business
ramifications.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

After the course you will be able to:

1. articulate a list of ways doing business
in a global context differs from doing
business within a single national
jurisdiction (because of differences in
law, language, culture, political
systems, currency, development levels
and other matters);

2. better understand China which is as an
example of an important "emerging" or
"transition" economy and whose
development is a "megatrend" almost
certain to shape your life and experience
in business (because of China's
importance as a manufacturing base,
market, source of capital and destination
for investing capital and significant
nation in terms of its military, political
and environmental influence) and

3. write well, or at least with more
confidence and fluency than you had
before the course, because this is an
essential skill in your toolkit, and also
because the course is designated as a
"W" or writing course.

These are the main course objectives.

Additionally, after this course you should:

� Be able to articulate causes and
consequences of globalization and its
multifaceted impact on business practices.

� Appreciate some important differences
among countries and cultures that impact
business.

� Describe alternative means of
participation in global commerce and
articulate the pros and cons of these
alternatives in different contexts.

� Understand key terms and concepts in
international trade theory.

� Understand the interplay of international
and municipal (or �national�) law onUnderstand the interplay of international
and municipal (or �national�) law on
commerce and how trans-national
organizations such as the World Trade
Organization and European Union affect
business.

� Be aware of common ethical dilemmas
that arise in relation to international
business.

� Be able to articulate some of the key
consequences and challenges of China�s
economic transformation.

NOTES:

� Exams will consist mainly of objective
questions, such as multiple-choice and
true/false problems and questions that
require brief written responses. The first
exams will cover the material from the
textbook and introductory lectures. The
second exam will cover the material on
China. The final exam will cover the
material presented in the final third of the
quarter including student presentations
(the final is not cumulative or
comprehensive).

� Details about a graded, outside-of-class
individual writing assignments (of about
5 pages, single spaced) will be discussed
in class.

� You will work on team project that
includes a class presentation and a final
paper. You may work on this individually
or as part of a team having four to five
members. You or your team will pick a
country (with approval from the
instructor) and make a 20-minute
presentation to the class concerning the
chosen country with respect to a specific
business venture. The presentation should
be through, profiling your subject country
using resources and categories of analysis
discussed during the semester. However,
the presentation should also be concise,
engaging and focused enough so that a
busy executive would find the material
memorable and the signal-to-noise ratio
high.

� Along with the final oral class
presentation, you or your team will submit
a written paper to the professor on the
day of the final exam. The paper will be
no more than 20 textual pages (with the
bibliography, title page and other ancillary
material not included in the page count).
The paper will provide citations to
credible data sources and summarize the
key findings of your research. Imagine the
paper as advice to an executive regarding
whether and how to expand the given
venture to the particular place you
evaluated.

� You are responsible for all material
presented during class (or discussed in
class) and for all assigned material in the
textbook and other readings. You must
also be reasonably conversant with
current international affairs, particularly
those with significant implications for
business. Examples of the type of current
events questions that may appear on
quizzes or exams will be provided early in
the semester.

� Preparation for every class is a basic
course requirement. In order to
participate effectively, you must carefully
study the assigned reading before each
class and bring your textbook (or at least
its relevant portions) or assigned book to
class for reference. You must also bring a
writing instrument and paper (�duh�).

� Class participation grades will be
assigned based on the instructor�s
judgment regarding the quantity and
quality of each student�s participation.
Attendance alone does not constitute
sufficient class participation, though
repeated absences will diminish your class
participation score. Students may
volunteer to speak in class and may also
be called upon. Students who are
especially reluctant to speak during class
should see the instructor during office
hours; I am willing to coach you to help
overcome apprehensions, but failure to
attend and participate robustly in class
discussions will negatively affect your
grade.

� If you only cram before exams, less
learning occurs and class meetings are
much less fun. To help encourage you to
build your knowledge incrementally,
periodic, un-announced quizzes will be
given. No make-up quizzes are available.
However, all students will have an
opportunity to earn more than 100 points
on quizzes�through extra quizzes and
extra credit questions on particular
quizzes. Thus, if you miss or bomb a
single quiz it should not devastate your
final grade.

� Make-up exams are allowed only under
extraordinary circumstances and at the
sole discretion of Prof. Hutchens.

� As a moral person, you do not want to
cheat because it is the wrong thing to do
and you have a conscience. As a rational
person who studies business, you should
recognize that the small potential benefit
you might obtain by cheating on any
assignment is vastly outweighed by the
harm you would incur if caught. The
opprobrium and harm is so substantial, in
fact, that even if you judge the probability
of getting caught as quite low, it still does
not make sense on a cost-benefit basis.
Most UWB students do not cheat, and I
personally abhor academic dishonesty. To
be clear, if you get caught cheating, you
are likely to fail the assignment and may
also fail this class.

� In electronic communications, please use
your UWB email account and identify
yourself.

� You are encouraged to consult the
syllabus, ask other students and talk with
me about a missed class, but as a rule
asking, �Did I miss anything important?�
is frowned upon. I hope the answer is
never, �No, we all got together and just
wasted each other�s time!�

� Best wishes for a happy and intellectually
enriching quarter. I am looking forward to
getting to know you and helping you learn
about the global environment of business.

Your career and life are unfolding in a world that
makes �global business� an essentially redundant
expression. Even �local� products are now
commonly enmeshed in global supply chains, labor
markets, capital flows, and regulatory and
environmental webs. Even if you could source,
create and market a product or service within a
single jurisdiction, it is likely that you will face
competition that does not. Even if you and your
competitors are pure domestic enterprises, you are
still likely to be affected by global business through
the prices you pay for commodities, labor and
capital. Thus, even if you never get a passport and
travel abroad, international trade and investment will
almost certainly affect you. Indeed, the globalization
of business has likely already had an enormous
impact on your life, influencing your clothing,
transportation, personal electronics, energy
consumption, food, entertainment choices, job
prospects and interest rates.

Complexity multiplies when goods, projects and
money cross borders. Differences in political
economy, levels of development, culture, language
and law dramatically affect how business gets done
in different places. All of the functional areas of a
business�including marketing, human resources
management, treasury and finance operations,
supply chain management, manufacturing, research
and development and strategy�can be dramatically
affected when geographical contexts shift.
To help you thrive in this global environment,
this course will first provide a framework for
understanding how the global environment of
business differs from doing business in a purely
local or single-country context.

After setting this broad �horizontal� context we
will next study China in particular, adding a
�vertical� dimension to the course. China�s
importance in the world economy is obvious�it is a
1) key base of production, 2) vast potential market,
3) source of capital and 4) target for investments. It
also has growing cultural, political and
environmental importance. The material studied in
the first part of the course will helps us understand
some of the challenges of doing business China. For
example, China will illustrate some of the
difficulties of doing business in �emerging� and
�transitional� economies. These lessons may be
applicable to other important markets. We will also
pay some attention to India as another important
developing economy that in some ways is quite
similar to and in other ways quite different from
China.
To conclude the course you will collaborate
with other students to offer advice about where and
how a particular business should expand globally.
�Writing� is also an important theme of the
course (hence its �W� designation). By completing
1) a short individual writing assignments, 2) a longer
