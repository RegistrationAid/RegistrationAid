BBUS 300 - Management of Organizations 
Quarter: Winter, 2011 (5 credits)

Instructor: Tim Hargrave
Office: N/A
Office hours: Mon and Weds 9:30 to 11:00 and by appointment

Email: thargrave@uwb.edu   
Course meeting place: UW2-031 



Course objectives: 
This course will introduce you to the theory and practice of the management of 
organizations. A fundamental premise of the course is that management is hard, because 
there is no one right way to do it, managers must consider multiple competing goals and 
interests, and they must make decisions under pressure and uncertainty. Specific topics 
we will cover include teamwork, leadership, motivating employees, decision making, 
organizational culture and structure, business and corporate strategy, managing 
relationships with external stakeholders, and organizational change. We will pay 
particular attention to the ethical dimensions of managerial decision-making. 

 
An important objective of the course is the development of critical thinking skills. The 
exam and group assignment will emphasize applying, critiquing, and integrating ideas. 
Having the ability to think critically and express your ideas will be important throughout 
your coursework in the Business program, in your career, and in life. 

Class meetings: 

Class meetings will involve a mix of lecture, videos, case studies, and discussion, both in 
groups and as a class. Out of respect for other students and me, you should make sure 
your cell phone is off and refrain from texting, checking your email, browsing the 
internet, etc. etc. You may use the internet during class for class purposes only. 


Course website: 

I have established a class homepage on Catalyst. Go to: 
https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/hargrave/18214/. You will need to use your UW Net 
ID. I will use Catalyst to make my lecture overheads available, post grades, and send you 
messages. Catalyst also has other features such as a discussion board, a drop box for final 
reports, and shared workspaces, which you may want to use for your group reports. 

 
Required textbook: 

The course textbook is Principles of Management: A Practical Introduction by Charles 
W.L. Hill and Steven L. McShane. It is published by McGraw-Hill Irwin. 

 

Assessment: 

Exams (2): 40% of course grade 
Group report: 30% 
Individual report: 20% 
Class contribution: 10% 

 
Exams (40%): Both exams will be closed book. Each is worth twenty percent of your 
course grade. You may bring in a one-page (two-sided) note sheet to each. The exams 
will be composed primarily if not entirely of essay questions which will require you to 
understand, apply, and integrate concepts from class. The second exam primarily will 
cover the material presented after the midterm, but may also require you to draw upon 
key concepts and lessons presented before the midterm. 

 
Group reports (30%): You will form groups at the beginning of the quarter and then 
choose a company that will be the subject of two group reports. Descriptions of the two 
reports’ requirements are posted on Catalyst. The first report is worth ten percent of the 
course grade and the final report is worth 20 percent. 

 
Individual report (20%): Individually each of you will submit a report about an 
organization to which you belong. This likely will be a company you work at but it could 
be a club you belong to or something else. You can choose a sub-unit of an organization 
such as a division, office, or team. 

 
The purpose of the paper is to apply concepts from class to analyze and make 
recommendations regarding the management of the organization. See Catalyst for further 
description of the report’s requirements. You will first submit a draft of this report, then 
after receiving feedback from a writing specialist you will revise the draft and turn in 
your final report. The first draft is worth five percent of the course grade and the final 
paper is worth 15 percent. 

 
Class contribution (10%): Each of you is expected to contribute to class and group 
discussions. Your class contribution grade will be based upon my observation, your own 
self-assessment, and the assessments of other group members.

- To increase your oral communication skills, including oral presentation skills;
- To increase your secondary research skills, including using business-related sources to find information, analyzing information, and reporting and citing your research results;
- To increase your understanding of and ability to develop effective communication strategies for your objectives and audience; and
- To increase your ability to communicate and work effectively in a group.


Grading for Managerial Communication:

Grades for Managerial Communication (BBUS 305) will be based on (1) written and oral communications assignments; (2) two group projects, a written report on a company and an oral presentation on the company; and (3) class participation.  

 Written and Oral Assignments (53%, 265 points).  The written and oral assignments due in class are described in the class schedule, below.  Further information about and any changes to the assignments will be discussed in class.


Please make every attempt to submit your assignments on time, even if you must miss class.  The written assignments (hard/printed copies) are due at the beginning of class.  If you fall behind in your assignments, both you and your team members may be unable to perform as effectively as if you are on schedule with your work.  Late assignments will be accepted at the next class session after they are due and will be marked down.  

Group Project:  Written Report on Company (20%, 100 points).  The written group project is a report on a publicly traded company that has at least four different products or lines of business.  The report must contain the sections described on the following page:  

A. Executive summary.
B. Introduction and company overview, background, and structure.
C. The company’s products/lines of business – including (a) history; (b) record of success (e.g., sales, profit/loss, market share); (c) current risks and opportunities facing the product/line of business; and (d) recommendations for investing in, developing, or changing this product or line of business so as to make the company more attractive to investors.  (Each team member writes a section about a different product/line of business.)
D. Conclusions and recommendations regarding how the products/lines of business should be prioritized to make the company more attractive to investors.
E. References, using APA format.  


Each team member will be responsible for writing one section on a different product or line of business (described above in “C”).  Each product/line of business section must be based on research; include references to at least two types of resources (e.g., academic article, newspaper article, database, web page, analyst reports); and include a chart, table, or other graphic representation of information.  The written group reports are due the last day of class.  Note:  The company MUST differ from the companies you research and report on in other classes.
Group Project:  Oral Presentation on Company (17%, 85 points).  Every group will give a preliminary and a final oral presentation about its company, the company’s products or lines of business, and recommendations for the company.  Every group member must participate in the presentation, and presentations must include computer-generated visual aids.  Each group’s final presentation must last no more than 15 minutes (12 minutes for three-person teams).
Class Participation (10%, 50 points).  Your class participation grade will be based on your participation in and contribution to class and to your group.

Course Expectations and Grading Policies:

- Class Participation (Weight: 18%)
BUS 320 students are expected to fully and positively participate in every class in order to ensure complete mastery of the course content and receive full credit. Full and positive participation is defined as: (1) Regularly providing constructive inputs that demonstrate a solid understanding of the material (2) Being prepared for and remaining engaged in class discussions and activities and (3) Arriving to class and back from breaks in a punctual manner.

Notes about Participation:
1. Each of the quarter’s 18 classes is worth one participation point that can be earned on the basis of full and positive participation as defined above.
2. There is no need to inform the instructor if a student is going to be occasionally late or absent from class. However, if a student is going to miss numerous classes due to an emergency, then the student should contact the instructor.
3. There will be some “bonus point” opportunities during the quarter that may help make up for a few missed participation points.

- Pop Quizzes and Case Assignments (Weight: 30%)
Pop Quizzes will cover key points from the previous classes, assigned articles, videos and textbook material. Missed pop quizzes cannot be made up, and an early departure from a class will result in zero quiz credit for that day.

Case Assignments will be announced in the Weekly Class Schedule or assigned in the class in which they are to be discussed. They will be worth between two and six points each, but missed or late assignments may not earn full credit. Students who plan to miss class can ask a classmate to submit a written case assignment on their behalf, however. Email copies will not be accepted unless specifically requested by the instructor.

- Course Project  (Weight: 32%)
The Course Project is a cornerstone of the BUS 320 course and involves the development of a Marketing Brief and the creation of a multi-media ad that are both due on March 09. Specific details are provided in the Course Project Guidelines available on Blackboard.

- Mid-Term Exam and Final Quiz (Weight: 10% each. 20% total)
There will be a mid-term quiz on February 07 and a final quiz (non-cumulative) on March 07. Substitute examination times will not be arranged unless it is due to a documented medical emergency.

Course Grade Scale:

Final grades for the course will be determined by the following formulae: (Numerical grade - 55)/10. For example, if a student receives 90 out of 100 points, then the final grade would be calculated as follows: (90-55)/10= 3.5.

Grade Discussions or Disputes:

Questions about a specific grade should be addressed in writing to the instructor within 48 hours from the time that the graded assignment is returned. Students should keep copies of all graded material until final grades are posted in order to help resolve any misunderstandings.


Class Courtesies:

In order to provide the best possible learning environment, students are asked to kindly adhere to some class courtesies:

- Punctuality:  Arriving late for class and from mid-class breaks is disruptive and disrespectful towards the instructor and fellow students. Once class begins, late-arriving students should wait outside until break time to enter the classroom.  Likewise, students returning late from the mid-class break should remain outside of the classroom until the class is over.  

- Use of Laptops and Electronic Devices:  Laptops and PDAs do little to enhance one’s class participation so please keep them off during class time. Similarly, please turn off cell phones to avoid class disturbances. Audio and video recording devices are not allowed.

- Food and Beverages in the Classroom:  Water, coffee and soft drinks are permitted. However, eating is prohibited in the classroom before and during class, and during breaks. A number of students request this policy each quarter in order to avoid a noisy, malodorous and distracting classroom environment.

BBUS 330 - Information Management and Analysis

Course Description:

Information systems and communications technologies have a central role in the economic and social
structures of our society. They influence business processes, organizational structures, and the way people
do business, work, and communicate with each other.

This course is an introduction to the fundamentals of information technologies and to the strategic
opportunities and challenges presented by these technologies. The course is based on the belief that
business opportunities and challenges are best addressed through a fundamental understanding of
management and technological concepts. Topics covered include e-business, collaboration through IT,
databases, telecommunication technologies, and IT security. While there is some introduction to technical
details, the real impact of this class is gained by understanding the impact of technology on how business
is done.

Until the end of this quarter, I expect all students to become familiar with the IT world and to learn
technological advances that might help create sustained competitive advantage both in your business and
personal life. To do so, I am asking all students to read two MIS articles of your choice approved by me
in the first week of this quarter. I expect these articles to be from reputable sources. There will be two
single-page essay summaries as homework on those articles. Your first technical task will be building a
website of your own. After learning enough technical knowledge in class, I will ask you to design
spreadsheets for business analyses. On top of these, you will build a database as class project.

Most of your homework grades will not depend on your design performance and time consumed but will
depend on your analysis of the results and your understanding of my course material. Therefore, (to allay
any concerns about the course load) showing that you understood course material will be enough for a
high portion of grade and the technical part will be as simple as it gets. For example, Microsoft Word can
be used to create a webpage in seconds after you decide on the material. As a final point, briefness is
preferred both in your essays and other assignments.

My ultimate objective is to familiarize my students with the technology issues and problems companies
face. To reach this goal I will provide an understanding of IT manager’s role on how and why companies
acquire, apply and evaluate information systems. I will teach the concepts on core technologies vital to
enterprise IT management including web tools. At the end of this quarter, I expect my students to be
comfortable to take an active role in today’s dynamic IT business environment and understand the role of
management in IT solutions.

Assignments, Quizzes, etc: 30%
Participation:             15%
Midterm exam:              25%
Final exam:                30%


Assignments, Quizzes, etc:

There will be homework assignments and quizzes to supplement and reinforce your learning. Each
assignment must be submitted in the proper format at a specific time that will be announced in class.
Homework handed in after the due time and during the next 24 hours will receive half credit. Homework
will not be accepted more than 24 hours late. Quizzes may be given occasionally in class. These cannot be
made up if missed.

I will not take attendance every class. However, you will learn more if you are in class daily to listen, take
notes and have your questions answered. Class participation will be a substantial part of your final grade.
Class participation includes behaviors such as asking questions, listening attentively, and participating in
discussions.

In class participation, things I view positively include:

asking insightful questions about assigned readings
redirecting a discussion when the current point has been adequately covered
good analysis supported by case facts or your own experience
summarizing or reconciling previous comments
constructive disagreement
synthesizing and advancing the discussion
a good sense of humor
drawing generic learning points from a particular case

Factors I view negatively include:

lack of involvement - silence, detachment or disinterest
leading our discussion into unrelated topics
spending undue amount of time on minor points
long, rambling comments
being absent or unprepared, or passing on a cold call



There will be a midterm and a final. Exams will be closed-book and in a multiple-choice test format.
Book chapters to be tested in exams are not cumulative. If a student misses a midterm exam for an
extreme emergency, s/he can have the final exam grade count for both the missed midterm and final.
Therefore final exam will constitute a greater portion of the total grade. The extreme emergency must be
approved before the exam date. This is a guts move and not recommended.

There are no individual exam curves. If a curve is needed on the final course grades, it will be applied. If
the class average is low, I will curve. If the class average is high, I will not “curve down.”

Classroom Conduct:

Students are responsible for the material presented in each class session. If a session is missed, the student
is responsible for obtaining class notes and handouts from another student.

Out of respect for your fellow students and me, please turn off cell phones, refrain from texting, chatting,
or using your laptop for activities other than class purposes.

Students coming to class late create a disruption. Although this is sometimes unavoidable, please make
every effort to be on time. If you arrive late please take a seat at the back of the room to be as unobtrusive
as possible. If you need to leave early, please take a seat by the door so you can leave quietly without
disrupting the class. If you arrive late or leave early, you will be responsible to obtain from a classmate
any class information.

BBUS 350 - Business Finance
University of Washington, Bothell - Business

Instructor: Ying Li
Quarter: Winter, 2011
Office: UW2 - 322
Office Phone: (425)352-3413
Email: yli@uwb.edu



Course Objectives:

This course is designed to provide you an introduction to the basic principles of Finance.  A working knowledge of these principles is essential preparation for any career in business or industry.  The principles you will learn here can also be applied to making personal financial decisions such as investing your 401(k) funds or choosing between different mortgage options.  

In this course, you will learn how to use and analyze financial statements, apply the concept of time value of money, value securities such as stocks and bonds, and evaluate capital investment proposals, besides becoming familiar with some lessons from capital market history.  You will also get opportunities to develop your critical thinking, spreadsheet, and writing skills.

Required Materials:

A financial calculator:  A financial calculator is a must for this class. Many students already own the TI-83 and it will work fine.  If you need to purchase a financial calculator, I recommend the TI-BA II Plus, although technically any calculator that has time value of money functions (NPV, IRR, PV, PMT, etc) will suffice. 

General Course Policies:

   1. Attendance is required and is essential to your success in the course. Please make sure that you bring your textbook as well as the financial calculator to each class. I will grant up to ONE excused absence to each student. Every class you miss beyond the excused one absence will result in a deduction of points from your classroom participation/contribution. More than five unexcused absences will automatically result in an incomplete. Note that arriving late and leaving early may both be treated as absence unless you notify the instructor with reasons in advance.
   2. If you have to miss a class, it is your responsibility to get details of what you missed (including all announcements) from other students in the class. I would NOT respond to requests to “tell me what you went over in class on … day”.
   3. Please let me know in advance if you anticipate missing a class, the need to leave a class early or arrive late; please minimize disruption to the class by exiting/entering quietly. Please turn off all cell phones and pagers while in the classroom.
   4. You are required to keep the classroom quiet at all times. If you need to exchange a word or two with your groupmates, please do so quietly. Try to respect others in the room and maintain an engaging learning environment for everyone.
   5. You are NOT allowed to use a laptop in class unless you are told to. No text messaging in class either. Since individual student schedules vary so much, specific office hours have not been designated. Apart from seeing me before and after class, please make appointments so that they fit in your schedule. I am here to help you enhance your learning experience in every possible way I can.
   6. If you are having problems with the course or the classroom, please let me know as soon as possible. There are several resources on campus that can be used to address some of your problems.
   7. I will respond to most emails within a day or two, if they are properly composed and professionally addressed.
   8. Exams will be given on the dates specified in the tentative schedule listed at the end of the syllabus unless otherwise notified. Exams are individually based. You should remember to bring your calculator. I will provide the necessary formula.



Warning: Not following these policies will hurt your participation points.

Grading:

There are a total of 1000 points (100%). The distribution of the points is listed in the following chart.

Total                        100%            1000 pts

Five quizzes will be administered throughout the quarter. They are open-book and time-bound. Topics for 5 quizzes: Financial statements (Ch 2-3), Time value of money (Ch 4-5), Bond valuation (Ch 6), Stock valuation (Ch 7), Capital Budgeting (Ch 8-9).
Participation/Contribution includes  attendance and work you show me that you have done. It includes classroom discussion, questions I may ask you to answer in class, etc. In order to score high in this part, you need to work on the participation problems and be prepared before each class – read the class materials and do the exercises. The grade on contribution will be based on Quality of participation in class discussion. You may be participating by answering questions or working on problem solving in front of class, etc.
Homework: Weekly homework will be assigned and you are required to complete it by the due time. You can find homework assignment on BB site under Assignments. I will do a check in class for completion by due time. I will also collect them and check for correctness twice in the quarter, once by Exam 1 and once by Exam 2.  Between homework submission, I will call you in class to answer these questions and your performance will count towards your homework performance.
Topic presentation: We will form 4-person groups for topic presentation. I will provide major topics in finance area, for example, ethics, dividends, cash management, stock repurchases, merger and acquisition, leverage and capital structure, etc, as well as brief coverage/theory on these topics. You will individually pick the topic that you are interested in. 4 students that are interested in the same topic will be assigned to a group that will present on this topic. Each student is responsible for presenting on the topic he/she chose at the beginning of the quarter and the group will work together to make their presentation a wholesome, coherent piece. Each topic can have up to 8 students, divided into two groups. The rest of the class and the instructor will be watching and grading the presentation. Each group will present for about 8-10 minutes.
You are required to form a group by the end of 1st class and report to me the information on group members. Or you can wait for me to assign you to a random group. Once the group is formed, you are obliged to stay with the group unless you get fired by the group (for example, due to poor performance).
The distribution of how your topic presentation is to be graded (for a total of 100 points):
- Timeliness, the stories within the past year are preferred. 10%
- Relevance, how relevant the stories are to the topic selected. 20%.
- Critical thinking, how logical and convincing the analysis is. For more details, please refer to the rubric of critical thinking evaluation at UWB Business Program. 50%
- Slide composition, how well the slides convey information to audience. 10%
- Presentation, performance at presenting your opinions. 10%

Exams are in a format that includes multiple choices, short answers and problem solving. I will provide you with formulae needed. Suggested problems and homework assignments are a good reference to what you will see in the exams. Exam 1 will be on Feb 1, covering Chapters 1 through 5 and 10. Exam 2 will cover Chapters 1- 10 with a focus on Ch6-9 on Mar 3.
Stock simulation game: Our class will be participating in a game in which you have $100,000 artificial money to pick and trade stocks. You decide what stocks you are going to trade on (including buy, sell, short sell, as well as buy back to cover, you can even borrow money to trade, which is called trade on margin.). The trading period ranges from January 10, 2011 to Mar 4, 2011. The top 3 portfolio owner will receive 10, 5, and 3 bonus points for excellent trading skills. Below you get a detailed introduction on how this game works. Below tries to address your questions on the stock simulation game:

General Procedure:

To enter the contest you open an account at Investopedia (http://www.investopedia.com) and join the “BBUS 350” game by Monday, January 10, 2011. There is no fee to open an account or to enter the game. You should be able to start trading as soon as you enter the contest on Jan 10, but sometimes Investopedia doesn’t work quite the way I expect it to. I highly recommend that you join the game as soon as possible and let me know if there is any difficulty on joining.

Who Can Enter:

The game is open to all BBUS 350 students. I have to be in the game because of the way games are created on Investopedia. However, I won’t trade or compete, and I will eliminate myself from the final standings.


Earning Bonus Points in BBUS 350:

Students coming in first, second, and third in the contest within a class will earn 10, 5, and 3 points respectively toward their grade in the course.

Writing assignment: 

Write about your stock trading simulation experience. Explain why you pick the stocks and why you decide to do a certain trading at a certain time (for example, sell old position, buy something new…) At the end of the game, review your experience and summarize your lessons. Do you think this is a successful portfolio? What would you do differently next time? What work and what do not?
I would encourage you to diversify your portfolio but do not own too many stocks (say less than 5). Try to focus on the fundamentals of the stocks as you would be able to rationalize your portfolio construction easier.
The final version of your writing assignment is due on the last day of class, Mar 10, 2011.
Critical thinking is essential for college education. You will be graded heavily on critical thinking in Topic presentation and writing. The rubric of critical thinking measurement is posted under Course Document on BB site for your reference.

Studying Materials:

I will post power point slides on BB site, which provide an outline of our materials, but do not include everything that we do in class. You should read the chapter and preview the PPT slides, as well as answer concept questions before each class meeting. We will breeze through the “easier parts” that have been posted in the power point slides. I will focus on the challenging parts and work with everyone on problem solving, discussion , etc.

After-chapter problems are another source for you to get exercise, very important for our class. So make sure that you know how to solve the suggested problems for each chapter listed in the tentative schedule at the very end of our syllabus. The solution to all after-chapter problems has been posted on BB site under "Solution to after-chapter problems" for your reference.

COURSE INTRODUCTION
Many classes in business programs focus on how a firm
manages its internal affairs or on how a firm relates to
other private-sector parties such as customers,
competitors and capital suppliers. This course instead
focuses on how a business relates to government and
civil society. The premise is that government and civil
society can dramatically affect a business—indeed,
government and civil society can cause a business to
succeed or fail—thus excellent business managers must
deal successfully with the political and social worlds
(government and civil society), not just the private
commercial sector.

To help equip you to do this, we will examine a
number of case studies. Through this process you will 1)
learn about the specific instances studied (which may
related to industries or firms in which you will work), 2)
gain a richer understanding of the structure of
government and civil society and 3) observe patterns of
how businesses, government and civil society interact.
We will study enduring debates about the duties of
business and the appropriate role for government and
what economic and political principles and systems lead
to the best outcomes. At the end of the course you
should be better equipped to help a business succeed by
recognizing ways it can be affected by government and
civil society and knowing some steps you might take to
affect those interactions, as well as being conversant
with several important contemporary issues and the
enduring debates behind them.

You may find this course to be unlike some
others you have experienced. Although there is an
assigned textbook, you will need to do more than scan
the textbook, load some of its bullet points into your
short-term memory and sort through some choices on a
multiple choice test to do well. Some learning may occur
through such a textbook-driven process, but in general I
believe that “game” does not create especially valuable
skills or knowledge that sticks with you. We will instead
learn through careful, close readings and rigorous
discussions. Often we will read primary sources, not
materials that have been pre-digested to textbook level.
In class I will lead Socratic discussions about these
materials, pressing you to think through problems aloud
and apply your knowledge to novel hypothetical
situations. We will also have in-class group
presentations.

Some of you will relish the less structured, “real
world” nature of this course. Others may sometimes feel
uncertain, anxious or awkward. This could be because at
this point in your academic careers—16 years of
schooling for most of you!—you have become quite
skilled at discerning what a teacher wants and gauging
how to efficiently comply relying on the standard
accoutrements of student life (textbooks, course outlines,
study guides). This course may ask you to step out of
that comfort zone. We will often be studying matters that
are too recent to be in the textbook, even though it was
recently updated. If you ever feel adrift, try to relax. It is
natural to feel a bit disoriented in an upper-division class
that seeks to introduce you to complex, important, and
unresolved topics. The process will prepare you to join
the fray—not as students, but as active participants in the
still-unfolding, real-world drama of business,
government and society.

Required Readings

1. Students are required to scan a national,
mainstream newspaper each day or by some
other means stay reasonably conversant with
current affairs, particularly those with significant
business ramifications. The Wall Street Journal is
recommended.

2. Business, Government and Society: A
Managerial Perspective, 13th Edition by George
Steiner & John Steiner.

3. Handouts distributed in class or electronically

4	EXAM & PRESENTATIONS



NOTES:
• The final exam will consist mainly of
questions that require brief written
responses. You will be asked to identify
with specificity certain people, institutions
and events as well as offer broader
conceptual responses.

• You will work on final group project that
includes a group class presentation. The
membership of your group and topic of
your presentation must be approved by the
instructor by the second week of class.
The topic of your presentation will
concern a current issue of significance that
illustrates interactions between business,
government and society as studied in the
course, and your group will brief the rest
of the class on the issue. Your presentation
should be through, covering key details
and concepts. However, the presentation
should also be concise, engaging and
focused enough so that your classmates
and instructor find the material memorable
and the signal-to-noise ratio high.

• You are responsible for all material
presented during class (or discussed in
class) and for all material in the assigned
readings. You must also be reasonably
conversant with current affairs,
particularly those with significant
implications for business. Current events
questions may be asked during class and
may appear on quizzes or exams.

• Preparation for every class is a basic
course requirement. In order to
participate effectively, you must carefully
study and reflect upon the assigned
reading before each class and bring the
assigned material to class for reference or
have access to it. You must also bring a
writing instrument and paper (“duh”).

• Use of electronic devices during class is
permitted, but I discourage you from
conquering new levels of Angry Birds,
updating Facebook or texting during class. It
can be distracting to the rest of us, and if
you are physically present but mentally
absent it not only reduces your own learning
but tends to deny the rest of us the chance to
learn from your active class participation.

• Class participation grades will be
assigned based on my judgment regarding
the quantity and quality of each student’s
participation. Attendance alone does not
constitute sufficient class participation.
However, absences will diminish your
class participation score, especially in a
compressed format class like this. Failure
to attend faithfully and participate robustly
in class discussions will negatively affect
your grade. Students may volunteer to
speak in class and may also be called
upon. But please understand that is your
job, not mine, to be sure that you speak up
enough during class in order to score class
participation points. As business students,
it may be helpful if you think of it as a
marketing project—you need to market
your personal brand, lodge yourself in my
mind in a positive way, gain favorable
"mindshare" with the instructor and your
classmates. If you sit there silently, I
cannot know whether you are clueless or
merely shy. So vocalize. However,
dominating the conversation to the degree
that you marginalize others is frowned
upon. Also, while vigorous debate is
encouraged, be careful to attack ideas, not
people. Belittling other class members is
strongly disfavored. Strive to disagree, if
you must, without being disagreeable. In
other words, talk a lot, but don't be a jerk.

• If you only cram before the exam, less
learning occurs and class meetings are
much less fun. To help encourage you to
build your knowledge incrementally,
periodic, un-announced quizzes will be
given. I may also assign brief homework
assignments. No make-up quizzes are
available, and homework cannot be turned
in late for credit. However, if you miss or
bomb a single quiz or homework
assignment, that will not devastate your
final grade. Repeated neglect, however,
will of course have a substantial negative
impact.

• Make-up exams or presentations are
allowed only under extraordinary
circumstances and at the sole discretion of
Prof. Hutchens.

• As a moral person, you do not want to
cheat because it is the wrong thing to do,
and you have self-respect and a
conscience. Moreover, as a rational
person who studies business, you should
recognize that the small potential benefit
you might obtain by cheating on any
assignment is vastly outweighed by the
harm you would incur if caught. The
opprobrium and harm is so substantial, in
fact, that even if you judge the probability
of getting caught as quite low, it still does
not make sense on a cost-benefit basis.
Most UWB students do not cheat, and I
personally abhor academic dishonesty. To
be clear, if you get caught cheating, you
are likely to fail the assignment and may
also fail this class.

• In electronic communications, please use
your UWB email account and identify
yourself. Like most of you, I receive too
much email and have a busy life outside of
this class, so do not expect an
instantaneous response. However, if you
send me a note and do not get a response
after a couple of days, feel free to follow
up (I can be an absent minded professor).

• You are encouraged to consult the
syllabus, ask other students and talk with
me about a missed class, but as a rule
asking, “Did I miss anything important?”
is frowned upon. I hope the answer is
never, “No, we all got together and just
wasted each other’s time!” I cannot
reenact or summarize a four-hour class for
each absent student. You are, however,
always encouraged to ask specific
questions.

• Best wishes for a happy and intellectually
enriching (and short!) pre-fall quarter. I
am looking forward to getting to know
you better and exploring the interaction of
business, government and society with
you.

Your career and life are unfolding in a world that
makes “global business” an essentially redundant
expression. Even “local” products are now
commonly enmeshed in global supply chains, labor
markets, capital flows, and regulatory and
environmental webs. Even if you could source,
create and market a product or service within a
single jurisdiction, it is likely that you will face
competition that does not. Even if you and your
competitors are pure domestic enterprises, you are
still likely to be affected by global business through
the prices you pay for commodities, labor and
capital. Thus, even if you never get a passport and
travel abroad, international trade and investment will
almost certainly affect you. Indeed, the globalization
of business has likely already had an enormous
impact on your life, influencing your clothing,
transportation, personal electronics, energy
consumption, food, entertainment choices, job
prospects and interest rates.

Complexity multiplies when goods, projects and
money cross borders. Differences in political
economy, levels of development, culture, language
and law dramatically affect how business gets done
in different places. All of the functional areas of a
business—including marketing, human resources
management, treasury and finance operations,
supply chain management, manufacturing, research
and development and strategy—can be dramatically
affected when geographical contexts shift.
To help you thrive in this global environment,
this course will first provide a framework for
understanding how the global environment of
business differs from doing business in a purely
local or single-country context.

After setting this broad “horizontal” context we
will next study China in particular, adding a
“vertical” dimension to the course. China’s
importance in the world economy is obvious—it is a
1) key base of production, 2) vast potential market,
3) source of capital and 4) target for investments. It
also has growing cultural, political and
environmental importance. The material studied in
the first part of the course will helps us understand
some of the challenges of doing business China. For
example, China will illustrate some of the
difficulties of doing business in “emerging” and
“transitional” economies. These lessons may be
applicable to other important markets. We will also
pay some attention to India as another important
developing economy that in some ways is quite
similar to and in other ways quite different from
China.
To conclude the course you will collaborate
with other students to offer advice about where and
how a particular business should expand globally.
“Writing” is also an important theme of the
course (hence its “W” designation). By completing
1) a short individual writing assignments, 2) a longer
group paper that is part of your final project and 3)
several in-class writing exercises, you will hone
your writing skills through this class.

1. Students are required to scan a national,
mainstream newspaper each day or by
some other means stay reasonably
conversant with current international affairs,
particularly those with significant business
ramifications.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

After the course you will be able to:

1. articulate a list of ways doing business
in a global context differs from doing
business within a single national
jurisdiction (because of differences in
law, language, culture, political
systems, currency, development levels
and other matters);

2. better understand China which is as an
example of an important "emerging" or
"transition" economy and whose
development is a "megatrend" almost
certain to shape your life and experience
in business (because of China's
importance as a manufacturing base,
market, source of capital and destination
for investing capital and significant
nation in terms of its military, political
and environmental influence) and

3. write well, or at least with more
confidence and fluency than you had
before the course, because this is an
essential skill in your toolkit, and also
because the course is designated as a
"W" or writing course.

These are the main course objectives.

Additionally, after this course you should:

• Be able to articulate causes and
consequences of globalization and its
multifaceted impact on business practices.

• Appreciate some important differences
among countries and cultures that impact
business.

• Describe alternative means of
participation in global commerce and
articulate the pros and cons of these
alternatives in different contexts.

• Understand key terms and concepts in
international trade theory.

• Understand the interplay of international
and municipal (or “national”) law onUnderstand the interplay of international
and municipal (or “national”) law on
commerce and how trans-national
organizations such as the World Trade
Organization and European Union affect
business.

• Be aware of common ethical dilemmas
that arise in relation to international
business.

• Be able to articulate some of the key
consequences and challenges of China’s
economic transformation.

NOTES:

• Exams will consist mainly of objective
questions, such as multiple-choice and
true/false problems and questions that
require brief written responses. The first
exams will cover the material from the
textbook and introductory lectures. The
second exam will cover the material on
China. The final exam will cover the
material presented in the final third of the
quarter including student presentations
(the final is not cumulative or
comprehensive).

• Details about a graded, outside-of-class
individual writing assignments (of about
5 pages, single spaced) will be discussed
in class.

• You will work on team project that
includes a class presentation and a final
paper. You may work on this individually
or as part of a team having four to five
members. You or your team will pick a
country (with approval from the
instructor) and make a 20-minute
presentation to the class concerning the
chosen country with respect to a specific
business venture. The presentation should
be through, profiling your subject country
using resources and categories of analysis
discussed during the semester. However,
the presentation should also be concise,
engaging and focused enough so that a
busy executive would find the material
memorable and the signal-to-noise ratio
high.

• Along with the final oral class
presentation, you or your team will submit
a written paper to the professor on the
day of the final exam. The paper will be
no more than 20 textual pages (with the
bibliography, title page and other ancillary
material not included in the page count).
The paper will provide citations to
credible data sources and summarize the
key findings of your research. Imagine the
paper as advice to an executive regarding
whether and how to expand the given
venture to the particular place you
evaluated.

• You are responsible for all material
presented during class (or discussed in
class) and for all assigned material in the
textbook and other readings. You must
also be reasonably conversant with
current international affairs, particularly
those with significant implications for
business. Examples of the type of current
events questions that may appear on
quizzes or exams will be provided early in
the semester.

• Preparation for every class is a basic
course requirement. In order to
participate effectively, you must carefully
study the assigned reading before each
class and bring your textbook (or at least
its relevant portions) or assigned book to
class for reference. You must also bring a
writing instrument and paper (“duh”).

• Class participation grades will be
assigned based on the instructor’s
judgment regarding the quantity and
quality of each student’s participation.
Attendance alone does not constitute
sufficient class participation, though
repeated absences will diminish your class
participation score. Students may
volunteer to speak in class and may also
be called upon. Students who are
especially reluctant to speak during class
should see the instructor during office
hours; I am willing to coach you to help
overcome apprehensions, but failure to
attend and participate robustly in class
discussions will negatively affect your
grade.

• If you only cram before exams, less
learning occurs and class meetings are
much less fun. To help encourage you to
build your knowledge incrementally,
periodic, un-announced quizzes will be
given. No make-up quizzes are available.
However, all students will have an
opportunity to earn more than 100 points
on quizzes—through extra quizzes and
extra credit questions on particular
quizzes. Thus, if you miss or bomb a
single quiz it should not devastate your
final grade.

• Make-up exams are allowed only under
extraordinary circumstances and at the
sole discretion of Prof. Hutchens.

• As a moral person, you do not want to
cheat because it is the wrong thing to do
and you have a conscience. As a rational
person who studies business, you should
recognize that the small potential benefit
you might obtain by cheating on any
assignment is vastly outweighed by the
harm you would incur if caught. The
opprobrium and harm is so substantial, in
fact, that even if you judge the probability
of getting caught as quite low, it still does
not make sense on a cost-benefit basis.
Most UWB students do not cheat, and I
personally abhor academic dishonesty. To
be clear, if you get caught cheating, you
are likely to fail the assignment and may
also fail this class.

• In electronic communications, please use
your UWB email account and identify
yourself.

• You are encouraged to consult the
syllabus, ask other students and talk with
me about a missed class, but as a rule
asking, “Did I miss anything important?”
is frowned upon. I hope the answer is
never, “No, we all got together and just
wasted each other’s time!”

• Best wishes for a happy and intellectually
enriching quarter. I am looking forward to
getting to know you and helping you learn
about the global environment of business.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

After the course you will be able to:

1. articulate a list of ways doing business
in a global context differs from doing
business within a single national
jurisdiction (because of differences in
law, language, culture, political
systems, currency, development levels
and other matters);

2. better understand China which is as an
example of an important "emerging" or
"transition" economy and whose
development is a "megatrend" almost
certain to shape your life and experience
in business (because of China's
importance as a manufacturing base,
market, source of capital and destination
for investing capital and significant
nation in terms of its military, political
and environmental influence) and

3. write well, or at least with more
confidence and fluency than you had
before the course, because this is an
essential skill in your toolkit, and also
because the course is designated as a
"W" or writing course.

These are the main course objectives.

Additionally, after this course you should:

• Be able to articulate causes and
consequences of globalization and its
multifaceted impact on business practices.

• Appreciate some important differences
among countries and cultures that impact
business.

• Describe alternative means of
participation in global commerce and
articulate the pros and cons of these
alternatives in different contexts.

• Understand key terms and concepts in
international trade theory.

• Understand the interplay of international
and municipal (or “national”) law onUnderstand the interplay of international
and municipal (or “national”) law on
commerce and how trans-national
organizations such as the World Trade
Organization and European Union affect
business.

• Be aware of common ethical dilemmas
that arise in relation to international
business.

• Be able to articulate some of the key
consequences and challenges of China’s
economic transformation.

NOTES:

• Exams will consist mainly of objective
questions, such as multiple-choice and
true/false problems and questions that
require brief written responses. The first
exams will cover the material from the
textbook and introductory lectures. The
second exam will cover the material on
China. The final exam will cover the
material presented in the final third of the
quarter including student presentations
(the final is not cumulative or
comprehensive).

• Details about a graded, outside-of-class
individual writing assignments (of about
5 pages, single spaced) will be discussed
in class.

• You will work on team project that
includes a class presentation and a final
paper. You may work on this individually
or as part of a team having four to five
members. You or your team will pick a
country (with approval from the
instructor) and make a 20-minute
presentation to the class concerning the
chosen country with respect to a specific
business venture. The presentation should
be through, profiling your subject country
using resources and categories of analysis
discussed during the semester. However,
the presentation should also be concise,
engaging and focused enough so that a
busy executive would find the material
memorable and the signal-to-noise ratio
high.

• Along with the final oral class
presentation, you or your team will submit
a written paper to the professor on the
day of the final exam. The paper will be
no more than 20 textual pages (with the
bibliography, title page and other ancillary
material not included in the page count).
The paper will provide citations to
credible data sources and summarize the
key findings of your research. Imagine the
paper as advice to an executive regarding
whether and how to expand the given
venture to the particular place you
evaluated.

• You are responsible for all material
presented during class (or discussed in
class) and for all assigned material in the
textbook and other readings. You must
also be reasonably conversant with
current international affairs, particularly
those with significant implications for
business. Examples of the type of current
events questions that may appear on
quizzes or exams will be provided early in
the semester.

• Preparation for every class is a basic
course requirement. In order to
participate effectively, you must carefully
study the assigned reading before each
class and bring your textbook (or at least
its relevant portions) or assigned book to
class for reference. You must also bring a
writing instrument and paper (“duh”).

• Class participation grades will be
assigned based on the instructor’s
judgment regarding the quantity and
quality of each student’s participation.
Attendance alone does not constitute
sufficient class participation, though
repeated absences will diminish your class
participation score. Students may
volunteer to speak in class and may also
be called upon. Students who are
especially reluctant to speak during class
should see the instructor during office
hours; I am willing to coach you to help
overcome apprehensions, but failure to
attend and participate robustly in class
discussions will negatively affect your
grade.

• If you only cram before exams, less
learning occurs and class meetings are
much less fun. To help encourage you to
build your knowledge incrementally,
periodic, un-announced quizzes will be
given. No make-up quizzes are available.
However, all students will have an
opportunity to earn more than 100 points
on quizzes—through extra quizzes and
extra credit questions on particular
quizzes. Thus, if you miss or bomb a
single quiz it should not devastate your
final grade.

• Make-up exams are allowed only under
extraordinary circumstances and at the
sole discretion of Prof. Hutchens.

• As a moral person, you do not want to
cheat because it is the wrong thing to do
and you have a conscience. As a rational
person who studies business, you should
recognize that the small potential benefit
you might obtain by cheating on any
assignment is vastly outweighed by the
harm you would incur if caught. The
opprobrium and harm is so substantial, in
fact, that even if you judge the probability
of getting caught as quite low, it still does
not make sense on a cost-benefit basis.
Most UWB students do not cheat, and I
personally abhor academic dishonesty. To
be clear, if you get caught cheating, you
are likely to fail the assignment and may
also fail this class.

• In electronic communications, please use
your UWB email account and identify
yourself.

• You are encouraged to consult the
syllabus, ask other students and talk with
me about a missed class, but as a rule
asking, “Did I miss anything important?”
is frowned upon. I hope the answer is
never, “No, we all got together and just
wasted each other’s time!”

• Best wishes for a happy and intellectually
enriching quarter. I am looking forward to
getting to know you and helping you learn
about the global environment of business.
